Prerequisites 
=============
This is the Lab Recorder stand-alone application. The executable is launched by clicking LabRecorder.py in the src/ folder. This program requires that you have installed either Python-2.6 (http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6/python-2.6.msi) and PySide for Python 2.6 (http://releases.qt-project.org/pyside/1.1.1/PySide-1.1.1qt474.win32-py2.6.exe) or Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi) and PySide for Python 2.7 (http://releases.qt-project.org/pyside/1.1.1/PySide-1.1.1qt474.win32-py2.7.exe). If you currently don't have a Python installation, we recommend that you use the newer version.
